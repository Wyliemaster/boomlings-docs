# Introduction

Welcome to the [Boomlings Programming Discord server](https://discord.gg/hUME49bcm3)'s online iteration of documentation for Boomlings. Here, you'll find all sorts of information, documents, and resources for interacting with Boomlings. We aim to make BoomlingsDocs the most comprehensive and open source of information for the game, created by many people who have interacted with the game and wish to share such with others.

## Projects

Although Boomlings is a universally loved game, there aren't many projects created for the game. However, the lack of activity within the programming community has not stopped some people from creating their own Boomlings projects!
